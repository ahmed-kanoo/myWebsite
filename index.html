    <h2>Why Are Cats So Special?</h2>
    <p>
      Cats are so special because they give us <strong>attention</strong>, relieve our loneliness, provide <em>comfort</em>, are fun, and play with us. They give us affection and grant us special permission to stroke, pet, and keep them on our laps, which releases oxytocin, a hormone that suppresses cortisol, the stress hormone.

    <h2>Things to Know About Cats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats are fascinating creatures known for their independent yet affectionate nature. As obligate carnivores, they thrive on a protein-rich diet, and their sharp senses, especially their night vision, make them exceptional hunters. Cats communicate through body language, vocalizations, and purring, often using their whiskers and tails to express emotions. They're fastidious groomers, typically spending a lot of time cleaning themselves, and require a clean litter box. While some cats are social and vocal, others are more independent, and each breed has its own unique personality. Despite their mysterious reputation, cats form strong bonds with their owners and can be a source of companionship and stress relief.
